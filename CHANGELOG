Added fillBorder() function that fills the map with '%' as the borders

Added printMap() function to print the map

Created function randomizeSymbol() to return random chars like '%', '^', ':', '.' 

Created fillSeedLocation() function to fill the map with the random chars at specified random coordinates.

Created function randomizeSeed(), creates a random set of coordinates to place the random chars in the map.

Created growSeed() function to grow the surroundings of the specified seed coordinate until the map is no longer empty.

Created growRegion() function that uses the position of a seed then grows its surroundings with the same character value.

Added a scanMap() function to check if the map is empty or not in order to keep the growSeed() function running.

Added randomExits() function to create exits on the borders at north, south, east and west at random locations.

Added fillExit() function to fill the random exit locations with '#'.

Added fillPath() function to create a path to link the top and bottom exits and also to link the left and right exits.

Added placePokeMart() function to place a pokeMart at random beside the path.

Added placePokeCenter() function to place a pokeCenter at random beside the path.

Added map.h file where I created a struct Map inside of that file.
I moved the functions of my terrain generator all to the map.h file.
I created functions based on the struct Map.

Functions such as:
allocateMemorySpace() to provide memory for the map and exits of the map.
printMapStr() to print the map with its current coordinate.
copyTerrain() to copy the terrain generated from a 2d array to a pointer.
assignMapCoor() to assign map coordinates from the World.
exitCoords() store the exit coordinates.

Then we have the current main c file which is JaysonLeeHw2.c

This is where I created a struct world which consists of an array of pointers inside of it and the map 
coordinates, x and y.

Functions are created such as:
createWorld() to generate the world where all the maps are initially null.
newMap() generates a map inside of the world.
initializeCurrentMap() which provides memory space for the map to be created at a (x,y) coordinate
checkSurrounding() which checks the surroundings of the current map if it has been discovered before to make sure the exits are sync.

closeBorder() is a function that fills the exit with boulders '%' once a user reaches the edge of the world.

flyCommand() to fly to desired (x,y) map.

checkOutofBounds() to check if mapCoordinates are out of bounds

exitUp() dislays the map above current map.
exitDown() displays the map below the current map.
exitLeft() displays the map left of the current map.
exitRight() displays the map right of the current map.

Added heap functions to the program in order to run dijkstra's algorithm.

Added struct called nodes to store the cost and distance of the hiker and rival
in different positions of the map.

Functions created on main C file:
fillRivalValues() used to run dijkstra's algorithm to fill the values of the shortest path
that it takes for a rival npc to reach the player.

fillHikerValues() same as fillRivalValues() but for a hiker npc instead of a rival npc.

Added in a npc.h file to store npc coordinates and symbol 
Added in a player.h file to store player coordinates

Added an overlay map of NPCs. In order to move NPCs without disrupting the strcuture of the map. 

NPCs are spawned and they can move around the map according to the conditions they are assigned based on the assignment.

Added curses for PC movement in all eight directions
Quit the game using Q
Access mart and pokecenter using '>' and exit using '<'

10/26/22
Added in world, where user can move into new maps where there will be a set of new npcs.

Added in CSV parsing functions, to open csv files from /share/cs327 and /$HOME/.poke327/.
The function take a command line argument, either pokemon, moves, pokemon_moves, pokemon_species, experience, type_name, pokemon_stats,
stats, or pokemon_types.

Implemented a method to spawn pokemon at a 10% chance. 
Shiny pokemon spawn at a very low rate.
Pokemon levels increase as the player goes further from the origin of the map
Implemented a moveset for the pokemon encountered
Added a window when player encounters a pokemon, the window will print out the name, level, moves, and stats of the pokemon.

11/27/22
Implemented fight window when battling NPC and encountering wild pokemon.
In the fight window you can choose to battle, or access your bag, catch pokemon (but you can't in a fight), switching pokemon midway through a battle.
Implemented a function when you start the game, you get to choose which pokemon you want out of 3 options. 
The pokemon center can now heal your pokemon, and the poke mart can refill your items.
You start out with 5 potions, 5 revives and 5 pokeballs. 
Implemented a function to access your bag in the map outside of battle. 


11/30/22
Implemented function where npcs drops pokeBucks after the player defeats the npc.
Implemented a pokemon catch rate where the chance of catching a pokemon using a pokeball will no longer be 1.
Implemented a function where when you catch a pokemon and your party is full. The pokemon that you caught will be sent to the Computer in the pokemon center.
You can then go to the pokemon center and choose if you want to swap the pokemon you recently caught into your team with any of your current team pokemon.
Implemented a function where you will have to purchase potions, revives and pokeballs instead of a refill. Each potion, revive or pokeball will cost 100 pokebucks.
Implemented another function where you can choose which pokemon you want to start first in your team. You can access your current pokemon team by pressing the 'p' button.
