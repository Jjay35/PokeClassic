# PokemonGame

This is a pokemon game that will be ran on the terminal and it is coded in C++.

The game can access different maps

We will be able to move using the PC commands in all eight directions, such as 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9
We can then access the pokeMart and pokeCenter
We can rest a turn by not moving and allowing all the other npcs to move.

Now we would have the complete pokemon game.
We will be able to battle the NPCs and wild Pokemon.

At the start, you will be given a choice of 3 pokemon for you to choose from.
You can then use the pokemon to battle other NPCs.
You can also catch wild Pokemon and add them to your team.

If your pokemon dies from a battle, you can revive them using a revive item, or going to the pokemon center to heal your pokemon.

You will start with 5 potions, 5 revives and 5 pokeballs. If you ever run out of them, you can go to the mart and refill them.

And you can access your bag of items in the map by pressing 'i'.

NPCs drop pokeBucks after you win them in a battle. Use the pokeBucks to purchase items from the mart.
If you catch a pokemon and your party is full, that pokemon will be added to the Computer located at the pokemon center.
To access that pokemon, go to the pokemon center and swap that pokemon with any pokemon that is currently on your team.
Pokemon catch rates are not 100% successful now.
You can access your current pokemon team, by pressing 'p'. You can choose which pokemon you want to go first instead by swapping the pokemon around in your party.
